  <h2 class='c005'>I.<br /> The Hypnotic Experiment of Dr. Reeves.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Dr. Edward Reeves, the celebrated
Rheumatism Specialist,
is not a favourite with the members of
his profession. His methods of treatment
being unknown, coupled with
his refusal as yet to divulge them,
have given his enemies and rivals a
chance to accuse him of charlatanism;
but to the great rheumatic public he
has become a demi-god; and as long
as our changeable climate continues to
nurture this disease, his idiosyncrasies
will be overlooked by the multitudes
whom he relieves.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>In his genial moods, the doctor
tells many curious anecdotes, and how
some of his daring experiments were
made under rather romantic circumstances.
One of the strangest of
them can best be told in his own
language:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some time ago, I had, among my
patients, a young man who interested
me from the first. He came to my
private hospital for treatment of a
severe form of rheumatism of the
heart; he was attended by a younger
brother, whose devotion struck me
as remarkable, until I became better
acquainted with the invalid, and
discovered how worthy he was of
it all. He seldom spoke of himself,
except his one great desire to get
rid of the subtle disease that overshadowed
his life, and he seemed
anxious to aid me in every way
with the treatment Evidently wealthy,
gifted, and just about eight-and-twenty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>it seemed almost impossible to believe
his bright young life was constantly
threatened by the convulsive attacks
which had become more and more
frequent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Unlike most of my patients afflicted
by the same trouble, he did not respond
to the usual remedies; and I
realized that if his life were saved at
all it must be by employing heroic
measures. However, sure that the
disease was lessening its hold in
general, and only needed driving away
from a vital point, I awaited developments.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Late one evening, as I was seated
in my study, puzzling my brain with
some questions of hypnotic influence
over patients at critical moments, my
night bell rang. I went to the door
myself, and found there the nurse of
my young friend, who told me my
presence was desired at once, as the
most alarming symptoms had reappeared.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Stepping back for my hat,
my eyes fell upon the book of <cite>Experiments
in Hypnotism</cite>, which an old
Professor in Paris had sent me, remembering
my absorbing interest in
Charcot’s specialty, and a certain
power I had developed when a student
in the Latin quarter. This power
I had used to tranquillise nervous
patients, or to play practical jokes
on my friends, after the manner of
most young medical students who
discover they have any skill in this
direction. An idea occurred to me—Why
not inoculate my patient with
the powerful amount of virus required
to drive the disease finally from the
dangerous region of the heart, <em>while
he is in a hypnotic condition</em>?</p>

<p class='c007'>“In an instant after, all the perils
of the situation presented themselves:
Do remedies act if the patient is
under this influence? Will the final
result be the desired one? Providing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the pain be temporarily stilled, would it
re-occur after the hypnotic influence
had been removed?</p>

<p class='c007'>“These and other doubts so disturbed
me, that on my way to the
hospital I determined to avoid taking
any such measures, unless I found the
patient actually dying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I entered, I was met by the
brother. He seemed plunged in despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘He is going fast, doctor,’ he said.
‘Can you do nothing?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without a word I stepped to the
bedside. I found my worst fears
realized. At a glance I saw he would
not survive the night unless the
frightful spasms that were fast sapping
his strength were arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I took his hand and felt his
pulse, he looked up past me at his
brother, and gasped the one word
‘Annie.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Whom does he want?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘His <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>, doctor. My brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>was to have been married in a month;
but when he knew that he was threatened
with a probably fatal disease, he begged
me to help him quite secretly to try
this last chance for recovery; and so,
although he is within a mile of his own
house and that of his intended wife,
no one but myself and his faithful
servant is aware of it. To all our
friends we are hundreds of miles away,
looking after business interests. And
now it has grown worse and worse,
until he is dying, absolutely within
reach of Annie, to whom he is madly
devoted.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Will you be calm, and help me
to make one last great trial?’ I
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Great heavens! What can I do?’
he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Take my carriage; it is at the
door; tell the coachman to drive his
fastest to Annie’s house. Bring her
back with you; and, above all, explain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to her the situation, so that I can
count on perfect calmness.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without a word he was gone, and
as I heard the wheels leaving the door,
I turned back to collect my thoughts
for a moment before returning to the
sick-room. I had to count on at least
half-an-hour’s delay, and meanwhile to
quiet this horrible pain and wait for
Annie to help me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Once back in my patient’s presence,
I took his hand, looked fixedly at him
until his eyes caught mine. Then I
said, ‘You must sleep now; Annie is
coming, and you must be strong to see
her.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“At once a look of surprise, of joy,
followed by one of despair, passed
over his face. ‘I am dying, and you
have sent for her,’ he murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Sleep,’ I said, this time completely
fixing his gaze. Almost instantly the
spasms ceased, and he sank back
among his pillows like a tired child.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Not noticing the look of astonishment
in the face of the nurse (who was a
faithful old valet of the invalid), I
ordered him to send me the assistant-surgeon
and a bright young woman
nurse, whom I often selected for urgent
cases. They came at once. It was
the work of a few moments to inoculate
the greatest quantity of the powerful
poison that I had ever used at any
one time. I then made the usual
passes, and awoke the patient, resolved
not to risk any unnecessary complications.
I knew if his strength could
be kept up for three, or at the most
four hours, the battle was ours. But
could he fight it out alone? I did
not dare to guarantee the usual result
of the virus if he were asleep. I
could only count on Annie’s support
to help him out, for he seemed at
last ready to give up the fight. Even
now the impression that his sweetheart
was coming, added to the rest secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>by the little respite from pain, seemed
to be sustaining him, and all I dreaded
was that he would be too feeble to
bear the effects of the remedy in its
later processes, when the convulsive
attacks were liable to be especially
violent, as if they knew they were
losing their power over their victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A half hour passed, then three
quarters, and I heard the wheels stop
outside. I opened the door, went
softly into the hall, and met the brother,
pale, anxious, and—alone!</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘She is not at home, doctor. She
is at a ball, believing my brother well
and hundreds of miles away. I explained
all to her father. He has gone
to fetch her. Am I too late?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just then a moan from the adjoining
room told that my patient was
suffering. I returned quickly to his
bedside, and found the old symptoms reviving.
Again the temptation beset me.
I argued: ‘I influenced him easily, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>certainly feels no pain while hypnotised,
he cannot live unaided through another
convulsive attack. To be sure, I have
to fear that he can never be awakened,
and that the final effects of the remedy
may be lessened. At least two hours
must elapse before he is safe, providing
no new complications set in; and
meanwhile what an opportunity to see
if hypnotism prevents or aids inoculation!
He has no other chance. The
plan of fighting it out on natural lines,
aided by his own desire to live for his
love’s sake, has failed.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hesitated no longer. Again taking
his hand, I uttered the magic word
‘sleep,’ and he sank back as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Now for the great <em>coup</em>,’ I said,
and, turning to my young nurse, I
ordered her to take off her cap, put
on a hat and cloak, and follow exactly
the few directions I gave her. She
seemed to grasp my idea, and left me
free to follow out my experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“‘Annie is coming,’ I said, looking
straight into the poor fellow’s eyes.
‘In a few minutes she will be here.’
I hesitated even as I spoke. Can a
hypnotised patient be made to believe
that a <em>substituted</em> person is the one he
expects to see? But even as the
thought flashed across my mind the
door opened and the brother entered,
with the young nurse on his arm
dressed in walking costume.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Here is Annie,’ I said. There
was a moment of horrible suspense.
Then at a sign from me the young
woman approached the bed, sank down
on her knees, and took both his hands
in hers. A look of incredulity, of
wonder, of hope, and then one of
ineffable peace shone on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Annie, dearest, I tried to keep
it from you and to come back to
you free from this terrible trouble,’
he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Yes, dear. You must not talk to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>me. See, I am with you, I shall not
stir.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Kiss me once,’ he murmured.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The woman reached gently over
and kissed him, and with his hands
still in hers he relapsed into unconsciousness.
In an hour more the
danger would be over, but I must
then awaken him, and unless the real
Annie were present the shock might
ruin everything. The moments went by—the
sick man sleeping, the tireless
nurse kneeling in her strained position
by his bed, the brother pacing up and
down outside the door, and I, watch
in hand, dreading the last act in this
exciting night’s drama.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fifteen minutes more and I
heard a rustle, a murmur of voices
broken by sobs, and then silence.
Suddenly and quickly the door opened;
a beautiful woman in ball costume,
with jewels gleaming in her hair and
on her neck, glided like a spirit to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>bedside. The nurse, with a woman’s
quick intuition, softly withdrew her
hands; the other knelt and took her
place, and with her eyes fixed on the
face of him whom she had thought
far away and in perfect health, she
waited. ‘She is worthy of him,’ I
thought, as I saw her attitude and her
wonderful self-possession.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now for the test. Motioning the
others to leave the room, I awoke the
sleeper. His gaze instantly fell upon
his Annie’s loved face. ‘Hush!’ she
said; ‘you have been very ill; I know
all about it; but the danger is over;
all will be well, and I shall not leave
you.’ A puzzled look swept over his
countenance. Then he feebly whispered,
‘I was dreaming you were here;
but you had your hat on, dear; you
had just come in from the street and
found me.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I am <em>really</em> here,’ Annie replied,
‘and you must reward me by not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>saying another word.’ She smiled at
him, a brave smile, through the tears
that were coming now. This time,
with a satisfied look, he fell into a
natural sleep. I knew the danger was
over, and that I could safely leave him
with his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I passed out into the early misty
morning, I confess the thought of the
success of my part of the experiment
was rather swallowed up by my admiration
for that woman, and for the love,
the great unselfish, protecting love, she
had won from that man. Visions of lost
happiness came before me, and it seemed
to me I had missed something which
might have been mine, had I been less
absorbed in other ways; but just then
I reached my own door, and caught
sight of the name on the small silver
plate, <em>Dr. Edward Reeves</em>. And I
thought of the material I had collected
for a medical paper on that night’s
work, so I dropped the sentiment, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>went in to make a record of the facts
in the case (which has interested the
scientific world ever since) of a patient
actually getting the full benefit of a
remedy while in an undisturbed, hypnotized
state, despite all theories to the
contrary.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>II.<br /> An International Courtship.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>In seven minutes the great steamer
<em>Lahn</em> would slip her moorings and
sail for Southampton.</p>

<p class='c007'>Already the more cautious friends
of the departing passengers had left
the ship, and were finding places on
the dock whence they might wave
their final messages. The decks were
clearing fast, leaving mournful groups
of travellers, who were beginning to
realize how soon they would form a
little world of their own; and so they
were making quiet observations of each
other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>A tall, sturdy, young Englishman
was leaning over the rail, looking a
trifle amused at the scene about him,
and occasionally waving his hand to
two men on the wharf, who were
evidently “seeing him off.” He did
not look particularly sad, or as if he
had any especial interest in the voyage
beyond reaching his destination. That
he was distinctly a well-bred Englishman,
who knew his London well, one
could not doubt; that he was also a
trifle obstinate, might be surmised
from the pose of the intellectual head
upon the square shoulders, and the
determined look about the firm, well-shaped
mouth. Just now, he has
screwed an eye-glass into his eye, and
is looking at two ladies who have
crossed the plank, and are being
greeted by two elderly gentlemen,
each of whom presents them with
bunches of flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Something about them strikes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>young man’s fancy; perhaps he is
interested in seeing that they seem
quite oblivious of the fact that the
warning bell is ringing, and he is wondering
if the two men are to sail also,
when suddenly, just as the gangway is
to be removed, he sees them all shake
hands, and the two women are left
standing alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a final look at his friends on
the dock, he takes a turn about the
steamer, and far off on the side, quite
removed from the harbour, he sees
the younger woman standing, looking
out—not behind, at what she is leaving,
but before her. <em>Why</em> it is that he
cares at all what a perfectly unknown
young woman is doing or thinking
puzzles Mr. Gordon-Treherne. In his
five-and-thirty years, he has known a
great many of the fair sex; he has
had several rather close love affairs—with
various results. He was rescued
from what might have terminated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>an unfortunate marriage when in Cambridge.
The Gordon-Trehernes considered
that the heir of the family had
no right to throw himself away upon a
modest little English girl, even if she
were the daughter of the rector, and
deeply in love with the fascinating
young collegian.</p>

<p class='c007'>After that experience, young Mr.
Gordon-Treherne, or “The Arab,” as
his chums called him, from his love
of travel, determined not to hurry
himself about marrying. One or two
charming Frenchwomen almost destroyed
this resolution, and once he
was decidedly fascinated with the
daughter of an English general out
in India. But he had travelled the
length and breadth of the United
States, and never felt inclined to fall
in love with an American girl. Several
of his friends had married American
belles; and when young Lord Clanmore’s
engagement was announced to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the beautiful and wealthy Miss Lawson,
of New York, everyone envied
him; but Treherne had not cared
to enter the lists, although he knew
Miss Lawson well. Women said he
was a man with a history, but he was
all the more fascinating for that. Men
called him a good fellow, and said
“The Arab” was the best shot and the
coolest rider in the club, only he was
always running off to some outlandish
place, where his accomplishments were
lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just now his friends might have
been surprised to see him arranging
a steamer chair for the elder of the
two women who had caught his attention
on the dock. The steamer
has left the quay only a half hour,
and already an opportunity has presented
itself to make their acquaintance.
Etiquette at sea is very elastic,
and it only needed the usual attentions
to the comfort of the elder woman to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>attract the notice of the younger. She
has turned now, and with her hands
still full of flowers, comes toward them—a
tall, slim girl, possibly four-and-twenty
he thinks. He is dimly conscious
that both ladies are quietly
but elegantly dressed. Americans, he
fancies; and then the elder woman
speaks,—“Thanks, so much.” The
voice is low and musical. She must
be French, he thinks. She is a
brunette, and he decides that she
cannot be the mother of the tall,
fair girl who seats herself next to
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me arrange your rug also,”
Mr. Gordon-Treherne says, as he
raises his hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you; that is very comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And again he is struck with the
well-modulated tones, which he
scarcely associates with American
voices.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Still they must be Americans, the
young man argues to himself, but no
longer finding an excuse to tarry in
their vicinity, he moves off, and they
meet no more till dinner-time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, with the philosophy of
an old traveller, Mr. Gordon-Treherne
has interviewed the head steward, and,
foregoing the honour of sitting at the
captain’s table, he has asked to be
placed at a small one with a sofa-seat.
Experience during previous voyages
has taught him that there are
certain comforts not to be despised
in a side seat under a strong light.
He sees several prospective lonely
evenings, when he may not feel inclined
to hunt about for a good place
to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>At dinner Mr. Gordon-Treherne
notices two elderly men and a small
boy at his table, and remarks two
vacant places. Presently his two
interesting acquaintances of the morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>appear, and he has just time to
read the cards on the plates on either
side of him—“Mrs. Barry” on one,
and “Miss Stuyvesant” on the other—and
to comprehend that by some
blunder he is separating them, and
that he can only remedy the matter by
giving up his cherished seat, when the
two ladies arrive at their places. There
is a moment’s hesitation, and Mr.
Gordon-Treherne remarks, “Allow me
to change my place.” Suiting the
action to the word, he steps past and
allows Mrs. Barry to take his seat,
which brings him opposite Miss
Stuyvesant. Both ladies express their
thanks, and then, naturally, they fall
into conversation. They speak of the
steamers; Mr. Gordon-Treherne prefers
a larger boat, and refers to several
“ocean greyhounds” he has personally
known. Curiously enough the ladies
have made the same crossings, but
prefer even smaller steamers than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><em>Lahn</em>. “Americans, surely; ‘Globe
Trotters,’” he thinks.</p>

<p class='c007'>He mentions that he has just been
to the Exhibition at Chicago. Miss
Stuyvesant says that in point of
exhibits she preferred the Paris Exposition
of ’89, and so on, until it
seems as if there were no place this
young woman had not seen and about
which she had not formed her conclusions.
He doesn’t care for it though,
Arab that he is; he likes to travel, but
the women of his family have never
expressed a desire to go beyond
Paris, and he thinks promiscuous
sight-seeing outside a woman’s province.
He shows a little of this in his manner,
for as he leaves the table, the elder
woman says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How glad I am, Helen, that you
do not believe in International marriages.
Now here is a well-bred,
intelligent Englishman, yet he shows
insensibly what narrow ideas he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>about women. I admit he is polite,
and careful in small details of manner,
but an American girl of spirit
could never be happily married to
him. Their ideas of life are too
opposed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stuyvesant has evidently not
thought much about him, for she
only smiles in a vague way, and says
she has learned not to quarrel with
the old-fashioned notions of English
people.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I pride myself in actually
leading them, when they start in a
tirade against the very things I do
myself!” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a sadly worldly young
woman,” Mrs. Barry rejoins, “and I
wish you would marry and settle in
your own country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Mr. Gordon-Treherne
was idly pacing the deck, smoking
his cigar, and wondering if the self-possessed
young woman would appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>later on. “If ever I marry,” he resolves,
“it will be to some woman
who has <em>not</em> been everywhere and
seen everything. I should feel as if
I were travelling with an animated
guide-book. I wonder if that girl has
a home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then it occurred to him that Miss
Stuyvesant had merely answered his
questions, and as these had been
restricted to quite impersonal topics,
he only knew her name after all.</p>

<p class='c007'>That she was good-looking, agreeable,
and witty, he had already observed,
but she did not seem to thrust any
information about herself upon him,
as he had supposed an American girl
would. He did not see her again
that day, nor till the next afternoon,
when she was walking up and down
the deck with the captain of the
steamer, and as she passed him with a
little nod of recognition he heard her
speaking German.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Surely American,” he thinks,
“knows the captain already, and
speaks his language.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At dinner Mrs. Barry was missing,
but Miss Stuyvesant appeared looking
as calm and “well-groomed” as if a
heavy sea were not tossing everything
about, and obliging the passengers
to eat over racks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are an old sailor, I see,”
began Mr. Gordon-Treherne, “but I
fear Mrs. Barry is ill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, quite seriously ill,” Miss
Stuyvesant replied. “It is always an
ordeal for her to cross the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And has she done so frequently?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nine times with me,” the young
woman coolly replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Really,” he said with a smile,
“one might infer you had some designs
on her life, did you not look
so anxious about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, we usually have some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>excellent reason, we do not take this
voyage in order to martyrize Mrs.
Barry,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall have to ask her nationality
outright,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you do not live in America
all the time?” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not now, we are ‘birds of passage,’
and, like them, follow the spring-time;
our habitation is usually settled by the
climate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you know England?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite well, I was at school in
England, and some of my dearest
friends are living there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some church school,” he mentally
remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, then, perhaps you do not
altogether despise our little island,
and look down upon us from your
bigness with the scorn that most of
your compatriots do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is trying to make sport. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>shall foil him,” she thought, and quite
calmly said—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look down upon a country upon
whose possessions ‘the sun never
sets’? Besides, the fact that I stay
so much in England ought to prove
how much I admire most of its institutions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Clever girl!” he thought, “trying
to be a little satirical, and doesn’t
commit herself as to <em>all</em> of our ‘institutions.’
I must make her angry to get
her real opinion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then he said, “You should
see our English home-life. I am
sure <em>that</em> appeals to every American
woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a patronising tone about
this remark that Mr. Gordon-Treherne
felt would effect his purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed,” she said slowly, and went
on eating, as if the conversation were
beginning rather to bore her. Now,
why Mr. Gordon-Treherne should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>assume that Miss Stuyvesant had not
seen this phase of England as well as
others cannot be imagined; but there
he overstepped the line, and soon after
the decidedly cool “Indeed,” Miss
Stuyvesant left the table to look after
her <em>chaperone</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“An egotistical man,” she thought,
as she went to her state-room. She
had liked Mr. Gordon-Treherne’s
appearance, and being a cosmopolitan
young woman, was prepared to find
him agreeable. Now she thinks him
distinctly aggressive, with his old
conservative ideas of women and
English superiority.</p>

<p class='c007'>He, for his part, feels he does not
understand this American girl, who
refused to quarrel with him, but
suddenly turned and left him. He
knows he has not shown himself in
his most brilliant colours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The days passed rapidly. Mr.
Treherne and Miss Stuyvesant saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>each other at table, walked the deck
together, and to the casual observer
seemed to be mutually entertained.
But although they were in so many
ways companionable, they both felt an
intangible barrier between them in the
national prejudice that their first conversation
had developed—a prejudice
probably latent in every person, however
cultivated or travelled, although
in this particular case both of these
young people flattered themselves that
they were singularly broad-minded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last evening of the voyage, as
they were walking up and down the
deck, Mr. Gordon-Treherne determined
to broach the subject which he felt
they had both avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>A larger acquaintance had brought
out the fact that Miss Stuyvesant had
read for honours at an English
University, and Mr. Treherne was
obliged to admit that in this case the
higher education of women (which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>never strongly appealed to him), had
not detracted from her personal charm.
She, on the other hand, discovered
that he knew a great deal about <em>her</em>
country, and considered its possibilities
almost unlimited; but she felt that
he looked down upon its newness, and
she resented his opinion of American
men, whom he described as clever and
agreeable in their relations with each
other, but servile in their attitude
toward women. The dangerous topic
of national characteristics had not
been touched upon until to-night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Mr. Treherne is saying, “I
hope you have forgiven my frankness
in telling you exactly what my impressions
were of America. I could
not help seeing how charming and
bright the women were, and I
wondered if they did not despise the
slavishness of their husbands and
lovers. While the men are toiling to
get rich, their families come abroad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>their wives thus educating themselves
beyond their husbands, and returning
home, find themselves less than ever
in sympathy with their surroundings.
I never wonder when an American
girl, who has had a chance to see the
world, marries a foreigner of family and
education.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Mr. Treherne had been closely
observing his companion, he might
have remarked an ominous expression
crossing her face, but she only said—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have had several friends in
Europe whose fathers’ fortunes have
found them titles, and on the occasions
that I have stayed with them, they did
not seem wildly enthusiastic over the
equality of companionship. The head
of the house had generally gone to
town, or was taking a run over to
Paris, and I wondered if it suited a
woman very well who had been
accustomed to have a small court
about her at home, to find herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>restricted to a husband so little her
companion that she scarcely ever saw
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But then you see, Miss Stuyvesant,
she knows he is not down in Wall Street,
or in some exchange, staking all his
fortune on the rise and fall of stocks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” she rejoined; “in the cases
of my friends the women have to
consider that their husbands are
probably at Monte Carlo or Ostend.
But really, why should we discuss it,
Mr. Treherne? No one would ever
fancy <em>you</em> admiring an American
woman, and I, for my part, if I marry
at all, would only marry an American
man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With which delightfully feminine
declaration, Miss Stuyvesant says
“Good-night,” and abruptly leaves
the astonished Treherne to realise
that he has not made a good finish.
Not that he cares seriously for Miss
Stuyvesant; but Treherne is accustomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>to find that women like
him, and this girl, his instinct warns
him, does <em>not</em> approve of him and his
opinions. He feels annoyed, but
there seems to be nothing to explain;
his training and the circumstances of
his life have made him conservative.
He does not wish to love, nor does he
especially approve of a young woman,
however attractive, whose ideas differ
from his own so materially.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so next day, when he bids a
formal “good-bye” to Mrs. Barry and
Miss Stuyvesant, he tries to feel that in
England he has more manly occupations
than doing the agreeable to a
young woman, and that woman an
American. This is exactly what Mr.
Treherne does <em>not</em> feel, nor does he
mean to indicate it by his manner at
parting. And so he goes off, consoling
himself with the reflection that he certainly
has found Miss Stuyvesant a
pleasant companion for a sea voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Three weeks later, in London, when
the season is at its height, Miss Stuyvesant,
who is looking radiant in a
French gown, meets Mr. Gordon-Treherne
at Lady Clanmore’s ball.
She is on the arm of the American
ambassador, and as she crosses the
room with that unconscious grace of
hers he feels that every man present
would be glad to know her, to talk
with her as he has talked, and something
at that moment tells him that
she interests him more than any
woman has ever interested him before.
Just then she sees him, and he
fancies that a rather annoyed look
crosses her face. Then she smiles,
and he comes over and speaks to her
and to her escort, who seems to know
everyone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you give me a dance, Miss
Stuyvesant?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but I have only this one
waltz left. You see, you Englishmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span><em>do</em> think that American girls are
good partners—in a ball-room,” she
adds slyly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see I am not forgiven,” he says;
and then the waltz begins.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a waltz! Gordon-Treherne
has had many good partners in his
day, for he has always been a dancing
man; but never has he seen anyone
dance like this girl. When they stop
she is scarcely out of breath, and he
has only time to say, “Let me thank
you.” For her next partner had
already claimed her, when she turned
back and mischievously remarked,
“And you, you dance extremely well—for
an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It occurred several times afterward
to Miss Stuyvesant that he could do
a great many things extremely well;
and if he had only been born in
America she might have preferred him
to honest Jack Hamilton, who had
loved her since she was a school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>girl, and who was doing exactly what
Mr. Treherne had described in that
last obnoxious conversation—staking
his fortune in an Oil Exchange, hoping
that some day he could induce Miss
Stuyvesant to give up her Bohemian
life for the luxuries of a wealthy
American home. In an indefinite
way she had thought she might do
so in the end, but, while she gave
no promise, she was sure that Jack
would never change. And so she had
drifted on pleasantly and thoughtlessly,
caring nothing for the men
she met until this one, with his strong
opinions, crossed her path, and for
<em>him</em> she believed she entertained the
most indifferent feelings. He had
simply disturbed her. She did not
think his ideas correct, but there was
a sense of justice in the girl that made
her think herself narrow and bigoted
for not being able to judge things from
other standpoints than her own. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>was exactly what she was criticizing in
Mr. Gordon-Treherne.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be better to avoid any more
discussions,” she thought, and so the
two did not meet again until one
glorious autumn morning, when the
house party at Lady Clanmore’s rode
out to the first meet of the season.
Miss Stuyvesant headed the cavalcade,
escorted by Lord Clanmore, and as
they came up to the meet she saw Mr.
Gordon-Treherne, who was riding a
restive thoroughbred, and looking what
he was—an excellent rider. He was
talking to a handsome woman, beautifully
gowned, who was driving a perfectly
appointed trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is Lady Diana Gordon,”
Lord Clanmore is saying. “She is
Treherne’s cousin, and rumour has it
that the old estates of Gordon and
Treherne are liable to be joined.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stuyvesant feels for a moment
as if she were slipping from her saddle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and then Treherne sees her. He
raises his hat, and she smiles back an
odd, unconsciously sad little smile,
which he has only time to remark,
when the hounds move off. And
now all the recklessness in the girl is
aroused; she knows she rides as few
women can, and during the run she
follows her pilot, Lord Clanmore, so
straight that the whole field is lost in
admiration of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Treherne alone has noticed the set
look in her face. “Is she ill?” he
wonders, and he determines to keep
her well in view. He has hard work,
for she is on a vicious little mare which
she insisted upon riding, and as she
takes fence after fence Treherne grows
more and more anxious. The hounds
have come to a check just beyond a
clump of trees in the next field. Miss
Stuyvesant turns her horse’s head, and
Treherne sees she intends to take a
short cut through a dangerous low-boughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>copse which intervenes.
“Stop!” he calls, but she does not
hear him, and he knows his only plan
is to head her off, if possible. Turning
sharply, he enters the field from the
other side; as he does so, he hears
the crashing of boughs, and sees Miss
Stuyvesant’s mare coming straight
towards him. Each moment he
expects to see her swept from her
saddle, but she keeps her seat bravely.
He calls out to her to turn to the right,
for before her in her present path is a
strong low-hanging branch of an old
oak, which Treherne knows she cannot
pass safely. An instant after, he sees
she has lost control over the mare, and
he heads his own horse straight towards
her. With a quick, skilful motion he
grasps her bridle just as the horses
meet. There is a mad plunge, and
Mr. Treherne, still clinging to the
other reins, has dropped his own and
is dragged from his saddle. He helps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the girl to dismount from her now
subdued, but trembling animal. Miss
Stuyvesant looks very white, and Mr.
Treherne is offering her his hunting
flask, when Lord Clanmore gallops
back to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your empty saddle gave us a
great scare, Treherne. Are you
hurt?”</p>

<p class='c007'>For Mr. Treherne, too, has suddenly
grown very pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s nothing, Clanmore, just a
little wrench I gave my arm; that’s
all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Miss Stuyvesant remembers
how skilfully that arm had lifted her
from her saddle. In that moment she
knows she loves him. Every vestige
of national prejudice is swept away,
and poor Jack Hamilton’s chances are
gone for ever.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Mr. Treherne managed
to write a few words with his left
hand and send them back by Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Stuyvesant’s messenger, who came to
enquire after him. He said—</p>

symptoms please send me some token
by this messenger to assure me you

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>“Sister Faithful” she was
called by the Edgecombe people.
Her name was really Faithful Farrington,
but no one ever said “Miss
Farrington.” She had been born in
the old Manor House, where for fifty
years she had spent the most of her
time. Her father, old Nathan Farrington,
had been content to live the life
of a recluse after his wife’s death,
finding his greatest happiness among
his books, and in directing the education
of his two children. Francis
Farrington, the son, had gone out to
India in early life, and had risen high
in the Civil Service. He had lost his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>young wife, and after many years of
valuable work had returned, an invalid,
to Edgecombe, where he found in his
sister the most tender and sympathetic
of companions. He was content
enough to allow the whole responsibility
of the estate to rest upon her
patient shoulders. She, for her part,
grew up to know a great deal about
science and literature, but absolutely
nothing of society or the world. When
she was thirty her father died, and,
besides her brother out in India, and a
distant cousin, who was a Professor in
some London college, she had no one
nearer than the old nurse who had tried
to fill the place of a mother to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having a considerable fortune, she
lived on in her old home, attended by
the same faithful servants, exactly as
she had always done, except that when
the long winter evenings became
tedious, and books failed her, she
invited some of her townswomen in to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>tea and played a rubber of whist.
Her days were filled with good works;
every cottager in the neighbourhood
knew her, and she knew them and
sympathized with all their sorrows.
Wise in her charities, she was the
vicar’s most invaluable assistant, and
it is to be doubted whether he, in his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> of spiritual adviser, was as much
loved and revered as “Sister Faithful,”
whose tireless hands constructed wonderful
garments for the babies, and
whose name was borne by half the
children in consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>No breath from the outside world
had ever touched this woman. Once
she had gone to Paris with her father,
but it remained in her mind simply a
lovely picture, a little larger and more
daring in colour than the pictures she
had seen at the Louvre. She had
been up to London several times, but
that was to make notes at the British
Museum. Her life was in no way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>different from that of most of the
women she had known.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once she had seen an item in a
journal that struck her forcibly; it
mentioned that there were eight hundred
thousand more women than men
in Great Britain, and that a good
proportion of them were matrimonially
eligible women as regarded property
and accomplishments, but that they
were of the middle classes, where
marriage was most infrequent. Sister
Faithful had remarked then that she
knew a great many attractive women
who were not liable to marry. She
wondered why, for her education had
made her logical. And then she
reviewed her own life. All the male
members of the families of her friends
had gone to larger towns as soon as
they were old enough; the girls, after
a touch of boarding-school, had come
home to assume simple household
duties, and, an occasional curate excepted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>they did not often meet young
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister Faithful,” having for her constant
companion a man who lived in
books, had rather a better-trained mind
than most women. It had not been
allowed to wander, and her greatest
weakness was her way of bestowing
charity. She did not like to account
to anyone for it, and so tired mothers,
who sent their offspring to her for a
holiday, were apt to have them returned
in new and wholesome garments,
which showed that a heart calculated
by nature to be a motherly one was
bestowing its bounty quietly on other
women’s children. Strange to say,
Sister Faithful had not given any
thought to marriage for herself. That
she should ever leave her father, marry,
and have children of her own seemed
impossible. She was quite content to
accept life as she found it, and improve
the morals and manners of the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of the lower classes about her. And
now she was fifty, and until her brother’s
return she had lived alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had remembered yesterday that
it was her birthday and had celebrated
it by inviting the school children to tea
in her garden, which was in  its loveliest
summer dress. In the evening she
had received a letter from her distant
and unknown cousin, the Professor,
whom she had only met in those long
ago excursions to London, saying he
was “tired”—“worn out,” his doctor
said—and he had written to see if his
cousin would take him in for a few
weeks’ vacation. “I shall live out-of-doors,”
he wrote, “and I promise in
no way to disturb your life. I want
only my books, and to wander about
over your beautiful country.” She wondered
if she had been hasty when she
wrote back to bid “welcome to our
nearest of kin and our father’s friend.”
She remembered that after all he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>really a cousin once removed, and a
little younger than herself, and that
when her father had liked him he was
very young indeed. A glance at the
mirror re-assured her. She was very
free from vanity, and she realized she
was no longer young. The villagers
called her beautiful, but perhaps their
sensibilities, sharpened by the lack of
beauty about them, were keener in
detecting their benefactress’ fine points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thanks to her healthy, regular life,
Sister Faithful at fifty was very good
to look upon. The soft hair, worn
lightly back from the low, well-shaped
forehead, was only faintly tinged with
grey, and her skin was as smooth and
fresh as that of a woman of half her
age. It was not the firm, quiet mouth,
nor even the gentle, sweet brown eyes
that attracted one most; it was the
unconsciousness of the woman, the
very annihilation of self, as it were,
without affectation, that made one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>long to know <em>why</em> she was constantly
giving without any question of return.
No man had ever told her she was
beautiful; her father’s friends had
approved of her, but then she ministered
to their comfort, when they came
to stay at Edgecombe. She attended to
everyone’s wants, and seemed to have
gone through life without dreaming
that in some larger sphere she would
have been considered a very attractive
woman. Not that she was perfect;
she had her idiosyncrasies—as who
has not? but she had a disciplined,
well-trained, unselfish nature, that overbalanced
any faults. Even now her
one consideration was for Cousin
Emerson, who was to arrive the following
day. Would he be comfortable in
Edgecombe? Would he not be lonely
with her and only an invalid host to
look after him? These, and other
doubts crossed her mind, and, as a
relief, she spent the entire day overlooking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the sweeping and dusting of
the already clean house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day, the evening train brought
Cousin Emerson. As he alighted
from the carriage, Sister Faithful
thought him only an older edition of
the intellectual-looking man she had
met in London. He was evidently
still ill, and looked as if he had
burned too much midnight oil. Her
practical mind immediately swept over
the entire list of nourishing dishes
that she might concoct for him. He,
half-an-hour later, glanced over his
well-appointed room, and thanked
fortune that it had occurred to him to
stay with his good cousins.</p>

<p class='c007'>After dinner this occurred to him
again as he stretched himself on the
comfortable library lounge, and let the
smoke of his cigar curl up in slow,
bewitching rings about his head, while
Cousin Faithful read aloud in that
well-modulated voice of hers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>And so the days went on, bringing
health and strength to Cousin Emerson,
and great, unspeakable content to
“Sister Faithful,” as he too called
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Somehow,” he said, after he had
been at Edgecombe for several weeks,
“it seems as if we were more than
cousins. I shall reverse your name;
you shall be my Faithful Sister, as you
have been nurse and friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first he had accompanied her in
her long afternoon walks, when she
visited her cottage people, but after a
while he persuaded her to take all
sorts of short excursions on foot, or
again they would drive over the hills
about the estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evenings were perhaps the
sweetest of all to Sister Faithful, for
then her interests in the outer world
ceased, and, until her cousin came,
she had often felt very lonely. Now,
they read aloud, played a friendly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>game of cribbage, or strolled about
the garden when the nights were fine.
Autumn was drawing near. Cousin
Emerson’s visit had lengthened to two
months, and still he said nothing
about going. He was quite strong
again, and seemed to have lost the
melancholy that at first overshadowed
him. Faithful’s heart rejoiced as she
looked at him, and she did not allow
herself to think that it might end.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning, in early September,
the post brought several letters. They
were breakfasting. Faithful remembered
every detail afterwards. The
pungent odour of chrysanthemums
always carried her back to that
morning. Cousin Emerson had
gathered for the breakfast-table the
splendid bunch that adorned it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly a look of intense happiness
lighted up his face. “Faithful Sister,”
he said, looking across at her, “I want
you to be the first to congratulate me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>At last the woman whom I adore, for
love of whom I have been so miserable,
has consented to marry me. I doubt
whether, if I had not fallen into your
dear hospitable hands, I could have
struggled so well to recover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his excitement, Cousin Emerson
did not notice the pallor that swept
over Faithful’s face. Her voice was
steady as she said, “Why have you
not let us sympathize with you all
along?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it all seemed so hopeless,” he
said, “and I could not bear to open
the old wound; but I am to go up to
London at once, and I shall bring my
bride straight to Edgecombe, if I
may.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night he left, after many cordial
expressions of gratitude, and Sister
Faithful, apparently unmoved, saw
him go; but afterward she had no
mind to wander about the garden, or
read a favourite book. She went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>quietly to her room, and, for the first
time, wept.</p>

<p class='c007'>She knew she had been companionable
to this man; that in her
society he had found peace and
content. And yet—in a moment—he
had forgotten it all; he had gone to
win some other woman, impelled
by what he called love. Was it love
she felt for him? Even then, in her
loneliness, with a grey-skyed future
before her, and no prospect of change,
she felt only her own inconsistency.
“He was my kinsman and guest; he
never asked me to love him, and he
never knew my feeling for him,” she
argued, and so the night passed, a
night of unselfish sorrow for the lonely
woman, while the man was being
whirled towards the one being who
engrossed <em>his</em> thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterward, when Cousin Emerson
and his wife came to Edgecombe to
visit, he remarked, in the privacy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>their room, that Cousin Faithful had
aged terribly; but to the poor people
she seemed more saintly than ever, for
after that one happy summer—the
only time she had ever allowed herself
any personal happiness—she had
returned to her charities as if she
wished to make up for some neglect.
And when the villagers called her
“Sister Faithful,” she felt it almost as
a reproach that she had dared hope
for any other name.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IV.<br /> Miss Cameron’s Art Sale.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Katherine Cameron was
spending her third winter in
Paris. The first year she had led a
quiet, uneventful student’s life. The
second season she launched out a
little into society as represented by
the English and American colonies,
and now she was spoken of as that
“clever and rich Miss Cameron,”
whom the English-speaking residents
remembered to have seen at various
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">musicales</span></i> the year before.</p>

<p class='c007'>On her return from America, with
the reputation of added wealth, she
found herself invited everywhere.
Everyone wondered that she did not
marry, for she was a young woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>whom men admired apart from her
money and accomplishments. But
although she went out a great deal,
and was usually surrounded by a
little court of struggling tenors and
impecunious titles, she seemed unmoved
by all the attention she received, and
apparently was not even greatly
amused.</p>

<p class='c007'>The truth was, Katherine Cameron,
being a clever girl, had seen through
the artificiality of it all, and still could
not bear to give up the illusion she
had cherished all her life, that she
should find her <em>real</em> sphere in the
society she would meet in Paris; it
might be among her own country
people, but they would be broadened
by travel and study until all desirable
and agreeable qualities would be
blended into a harmonious whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she decided to pass the
winter with her aunt, Mrs. Montgomery,
it was with the sweet hope that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>should be able to realise her dreams
of a little “Salon”—a revival of that
delightful French institution and formulated
on the same lines, but having
American cleverness and adaptability
added to it. It seemed feasible. Mrs.
Montgomery had lived in Paris for
years, and she knew all the resident
society people, the rest of the “floating
population” were usually provided
with letters of introduction to her.
Her “Tuesdays At Home” were delightful
functions. Katherine Cameron
had great respect for her aunt’s discrimination,
which often seemed prophetic,
and caused uninitiated people
to wonder <em>how</em> Mrs. Montgomery
happened to have “taken up” some
artist or singer who afterwards became
famous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still Katherine was not entirely
satisfied. Men liked her, but thought
her cold; at any rate, she never
fulfilled any promise of a flirtation that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>her agreeable manners might suggest.
Women said she was ambitious, that
she would only marry some distinguished
foreigner, and yet Miss Cameron, who
sometimes used forcible expressions,
had been heard to say, “She would
marry a ‘Hottentot’ if she loved him.”
She was honestly trying to get some
good out of her surroundings, and was
perfectly willing to fall in love, or to
gratify her intellectual tastes, just as
it might happen. Up to this time,
however, she had been distinctly
heart-whole, and aside from an occasional
charming man or woman whom
she met in society, or the interesting
art students whom she knew (and liked
best of all), it seemed to her clear and
practical mind that there was a great
deal of “padding,” as she expressed
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>She resented, as a patriotic American
woman of culture and refinement, that
the so-called “exclusive” circles in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>American quarter accepted some of
the families who would not occupy
conspicuous positions in their own free
and enlightened country. She could
not help comparing certain wealthy
young society women with a clever
but poor friend of hers, whose artistic
talent had been recognized by her own
warm-hearted Southern townspeople,
who had contributed a sufficient sum
to send Miss Paterson abroad, confident
that her brush would one day repay
them. The two young women had
met at the studio of a common friend,
and Miss Cameron, who professed to
know nothing of art, had asked such
intelligent questions of the young
student that Miss Paterson, with a
woman’s quick intuition, had surmised
that her fashionable countrywoman had
a more artistic nature than she admitted.
A friendship was begun, and Katherine
Cameron became the <em>confidante</em> and
admirer of the rising young artist.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Just now she has returned from a
musicale at the hotel of one of the
famous teachers, and she is describing
it to Miss Paterson, who has come in
for a chat and a quiet cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It makes me so indignant,” she is
saying, “when I think what an impression
we must make on intelligent
French people. Why this afternoon,
at Madame de la Harpe’s, it was simply
one medley of disputing mothers and
jealous pupils. Madame herself is so
distinctly a lady, that when two irate
mothers appealed to her as to which
of their daughters should sing <em>first</em>, she
shrugged her shoulders in true French
fashion and said, ‘They will both sing
many times; they will sing so well
that it will be doubtless required’—a
diplomatic answer! She knew her
audience, and felt that a programme
of twenty-three numbers could not
admit of many encores in one afternoon.
I noticed she did not deviate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>from the original plan. Then that
vulgar Mrs. Booth, from somewhere
out west, who has the gorgeous apartment,
and the family of extremely
pretty daughters, asked me if I would
join their French class. ‘We have an
actor, M. de Valle, to teach us,’ she
said, ‘he is just splendid—so handsome
and so polite; only he will make us
<em>congregate</em> verbs.’ To my horror, Mr.
Vincent, of the English Embassy, who
is so coldly critical of everything
American, overheard her, and I saw
him trying to suppress a smile, which
made me indignant, so I impulsively
replied, ‘I shall be charmed, Mrs.
Booth—so kind of you to ask me.’
And now I shall have to extricate myself
from that situation, for, although
I have a certain appreciation of the
ludicrous, I cannot sacrifice one night
of every week, even to show Mr.
Vincent that I despise his criticism.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have rather thought Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Vincent one of your admirers,” Miss
Paterson returns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Admirer? He sees in me a young
person who will not be apt to make
any very ridiculous blunders, and as
he <em>has</em> to appear occasionally, being
in the diplomatic service, he talks to
me as a sort of compromise between
the tourist element and his own fixed
aristocracy. I <em>love</em> to shock him.
Why, to-day, he said, in that deliberate
tone he employs when he wishes to be
particularly patronizing, ‘I suppose
you go in for all sorts of things, Miss
Cameron. I hear you are artistic, and
know the Latin Quarter better than
this side of the river. When do you
get it all in?’ I told him to behold
a young person positively unique in
Paris—one who was actively pursuing
<em>nothing</em>. And then he actually remarked
that ‘in an age where all the
young women were running mad with
<em>fads</em> it was refreshing to find one so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>confessedly idle.’ He aggravates me
so that I always lose my head, and get
the worst of the argument. But here
I am talking away, and forgetting that
I am to hear all about you and your
plans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Cameron soon proved that she
could listen as well as talk, for she was
most attentive while Miss Paterson
told her about a letter which she had
received that day, and which had
disturbed her not a little. In the
midst of their displeasure both girls
saw the ludicrous side of it, for it was
nothing less than a letter from Miss
Paterson’s townspeople <em>forbidding</em> her
marriage to the penniless young
sculptor with whom she had fallen in
love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What impertinence!” Miss Cameron
remarks; “talk about the tyranny
of European courts! Here you are,
an orphan, without a relative in the
world to restrain you, and these people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>fancy they <em>own</em> you, and can control
your liberty just because they have
furnished you with funds which they
ought to know will be returned to
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But there <em>is</em> a moral obligation,”
Miss Paterson replied. “I shall send
them back every penny of their money
as soon as possible, and I shall always
feel a debt of gratitude which no
pecuniary remuneration can cover.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Little saint!” Miss Cameron exclaims,
but she respects her brave little
countrywoman all the more, because
she is so visibly distressed at the situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us go over the facts,” adds
Miss Cameron. “Here they are
briefly: A number of your townspeople,
seeing in you evidences of talent, raised
a sum of money and sent you to Paris
two years ago. Two of these people
selected your masters (fortunately they
made no mistake there); you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>worked faithfully and conscientiously,
and have accomplished more than
most art students do in twice the time.
This year two of your studies have
been in the Salon, one of them was
bought by a Frenchman of critical
taste; and you have a number of
charming saleable studies, besides your
large picture of the garden-party intended
for next year’s Salon, in which
festive scene your humble servant poses
as the hostess serving tea to a group of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin-de-siècle</span></i> society people. You are
sure to make a hit with that, so many
of the figures are actual portraits, and
Paris dotes on personalities. It is
conceded that merit no longer wins,
but to be ‘received’ one must be a
friend of some member of the jury, or
paint the people whose vanity moves
them to pull some wire, so that they
may gaze down from the Salon walls
upon an inquisitive and envious
public.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“And in this case can I count on
<em>you</em> or some of your admirers to pull
the wires, Katherine?” Miss Paterson
mischievously asks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; that picture shall hang ‘on
the line,’ even if I have to lobby for
it; but you know all the artists think
it splendidly treated,” said Miss
Cameron.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hoped it would be received this
year, but, do you know, I have been
considering all day whether I had better
not sell it now, and send back as much
money as I can raise immediately; for
I intend to marry Edgar McDowald,
with the benediction of my patrons if
possible—without it if necessary,” emphatically
declares Miss Paterson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I shall aid and abet you,
especially if you intend to show them
that ‘love laughs at locksmiths’—and
creditors. But, seriously, why not
have an art sale? I am off to a
musicale at that extraordinary Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Smyth’s (formerly spelt with an i), who
begins every Monday morning sending
letters, followed during the week by
three-cornered notes marked ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pressée</span></i>,’
in which she ‘begges’ her dear friend,
whoever it may be, to run in Saturday
afternoon, and casually remarks that
some ‘celebrated musicien’ will perform.
The joke is they usually do,
and we all find ourselves there once or
twice a season. To-night the American
Minister has promised to be present,
and I shall profit by the occasion to
invite everyone to your studio next
week to see some charming studies
which will be for sale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Paterson knew Miss Cameron’s
influence, and felt that she was quite
safe in letting her friend have her way;
so after talking over the details they
separated.</p>

<p class='c007'>That evening Miss Cameron succeeded
in quietly scattering the
information through the crowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>rooms that a very charming friend
of hers, the Miss Paterson, who
occasionally received with her, would
have a little private art sale the following
week. Among the attentive listeners
was Mr. Vincent, who casually asked
if Miss Paterson had finished her
Salon picture which she had described
to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She has,” Miss Cameron replied,
and suddenly added, “And you know,
Mr. Vincent, I cannot offer my friend
money, nor would she sell me so
important a picture as her large one,
for she would think I did it to help
her; now, I want to ask you, as the
person she would think of as being
the last one connected with me (here
Mr. Vincent smiled a rather melancholy
but affirmative smile), to buy two of
her studies for me in some other
name. I can easily dispose of them
as presents, and she will never be the
wiser.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Miss Cameron’s wishes are my
commands. I will call on Miss
Paterson before Wednesday, and on
the day when the exhibition takes
place, you can be sure that at least
two pictures will be marked ‘Sold.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will give a business-like air
to the whole arrangement, Mr. Vincent,
and suggest to any possible buyers that
other equally attractive studies are for
sale. This must be a profound secret.
Do you promise?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Certainly,” Mr. Vincent replied, and
Miss Cameron knew she could trust him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He is really very likeable, when
one sees him alone,” Miss Cameron
soliloquizes; and then she reflects
that it is decidedly her fault that she
does not see Mr. Vincent more
frequently in his best light; she
remembers various occasions when
she has made their duet a trio by
addressing some third person, thus
preventing a possible tête-à-tête.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The afternoon selected by Miss Paterson
arrived, and as Miss Cameron
alighted from her coupé in the humble
street where art and poor students
hold sway, she remarked with pleasure
a goodly line of private carriages, and
knew that her scheme had succeeded,
and that Miss Paterson was the
fashion—at least of the hour. The
question was, Would they buy her
pictures? And then she added to
herself, “They must be sold, even
if I have to find other agents, and
buy them all in.” But the loyal girl
might have spared herself any anxiety.
As she entered the room, which was
artistically draped and hung with
numerous strongly-executed sketches,
she saw the magic word “Sold,” not
only on several of the small studies,
but conspicuously placed at the base
of the largest canvas, Miss Paterson’s
salon picture, in which Miss Cameron is
the central and principal figure.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Isn’t it too delightful, dear?” Miss
Paterson whispers to her. “An Englishman,
a friend of Mr. Vincent’s,
came here with him yesterday, saw
my canvas, liked it, asked my price,
and actually took it. Mr. Vincent
also bought two other studies, and
several have gone to-day. Edgar has
lost no time. He has disappeared
now to cable to my esteemed benefactors,
‘<em>Marriage will take place;
cheque for full amount on way</em>.’ Extravagant
of us, I know, and of course
it’s extremely ‘<em>previous</em>,’ but we really
see our way clear to happiness, and I
shall always feel <em>you</em> did it all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Miss Cameron shook hands with
Mr. Vincent that day she told him
that he had been instrumental in
making two deserving people happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was so thoughtful to bring your
friend here, who bought the large
picture,” she says. And then she
adds, “Did I ever see him?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“I think you have seen him,” Mr.
Vincent replies. Something in his manner betrays him, and Miss Cameron,
guessing the truth, impulsively says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You bought it yourself, Mr. Vincent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” he softly whispers, with
his finger on his lips. “We are
fellow-conspirators, and cannot betray
each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Next year, when a great American
city gave Edgar McDowald the order
for a State monument, the beauty of
his designs having distanced all competitors,
Parisians remarked that Mrs.
Montgomery’s discrimination, as regarded
celebrities, seemed to have
fallen upon her niece.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. and Mrs. McDowald delight in
telling of their romantic courtship, and
how Miss Cameron’s scheme of an art
sale brought about their marriage; but
Miss Cameron always affirms that its
success was not due to her, but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Mr. Vincent’s tact in exhibiting that
expensive canvas to his friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Cameron, being a worldly-wise
young woman, tries to feel that Mr.
Vincent’s motives were wholly generous
and disinterested; but if what rumour
says is true, Mr. Vincent would do
more than that for the charming
central figure in Mrs. McDowald’s
Salon picture, which now looks down
from a good position in the library
of his own English home, and which
never hung “on the line” after all.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>V.<br /> A Complex Question.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>There were a half-dozen or
more good riders in Tangier
that winter, but Bob Travers was the
acknowledged leader. At every annual
race-meeting he proved to his backers
that their confidence in him was not
misplaced, for, brave fellows as they
were, none of them rode so hard, or
cared to take the risks which Bob
cheerfully ran.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert MacNeil Travers, familiarly
known as “Bob,” was spending his
second season in Africa. The first
time he had run across from “Gib”
to look up something in the way of
horseflesh, and once there he had
easily fallen in with a set of men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>whose society he enjoyed extremely.
They were dashing fellows, several of
them young English noblemen, who
found the free, bold life they could
lead in this lawless place too fascinating
to leave. It was very agreeable
in that delicious winter climate to dash
off over the wild country on a surefooted
Barb horse, or to join some
caravan for a few weeks’ excursion
in the interior, while in England
everyone was freezing, or at least
imbedded in fog.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had their little glimpses of
civilization—the Tangerines—for the
few resident Europeans were very
glad to entertain any interesting
visitors from the outside world. Bob
Travers was as much liked by the
wives and sisters of his friends as
any gallant, well-bred Englishman
deserves to be, and every one was
pleased when his engagement was
announced to pretty Mabel Burke,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the sister of Boardman Burke, the
artist, whose Eastern scenes, painted
under the clear skies of Morocco,
have won for him the reputation of
being one of the foremost exponents
in the new “Impressionist School.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The occasions were rare when Bob
Travers was not included, whether
it was for a boar hunt, a day with
the fox hounds, or a little dance, at
any one of the half-dozen hospitable
European houses.</p>

<p class='c007'>One night he was late in arriving
at a dinner-party given in honour of
some Americans, whose yacht had
appeared in Tangier Bay that day;
they were already seated at the table
when Bob slipped quietly in, and, at
a little nod from Miss Burke, found
his place beside her. He was conscious
that his other neighbour was
a woman—a young and attractive one.
He had time to observe that, when his
obliging hostess, in reply to his apologies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>said, “You are punished enough,
for you have lost at least ten minutes
of Miss Schuyler’s society.” This,
with a knowing little look at Miss
Burke, which seemed to say, “To
be sure he is your property, but if
you are engaged to the most presentable
man in Tangier, you must pay
the penalty, and give him up to
occasional and fastidious visitors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Modest little Mabel Burke, who
simply basked in “Bob’s” smiles, and
wondered at her own good luck in
ever winning his love, gave her hostess
a proud, happy glance that spoke
volumes for her sense of security.</p>

<p class='c007'>A closer look at Miss Schuyler
convinced Mr. Travers that he had
never met anyone at all like her; she
was so self-possessed and clever that
they were soon talking as freely as if
they had been old acquaintances.
She was not so pretty as his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>,
but she was very fascinating (a charm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that even Bob had not attributed to
Miss Burke), and her versatility amazed
him. It did not seem to matter
whether they discussed horses, religion,
or politics—Miss Schuyler had her
opinions, and she expressed them
without conceit or aggressiveness.
During the fortnight that the smart
little yacht <em>Liberty</em> was anchored in
the waters of Tangier Bay, and its
merry party were devoting their days
to long country rides, excursions to
Cape Spartel, or cantering along the
sandy beach, Travers found Miss
Schuyler the most interesting of companions;
he seemed to have become
her acknowledged escort, and (since
one night, when he had nearly killed
his best horse by galloping several
miles for a doctor to come to the
rescue of one of the ladies who had
broken her arm while the party were
making an excursion) Miss Schuyler
had singled him out for all sorts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>delicate favours. He, on the other
hand, discovered that this woman, with
her grace and culture, was just such a
woman as he had pictured he should
eventually take to Travers Towers as
its mistress. For in less than a fortnight
he realized that in his happy-go-lucky
way he had drifted into that
engagement with the pretty sister of
his dearest friend. What could be
more natural? All the conditions had
favoured his courtship, and until he
saw Miss Schuyler it had seemed very
agreeable to possess the affections of the
nicest girl in Tangier.</p>

<p class='c007'>He knew she was not the wife
he had dreamt of, but then, he reasoned,
one never marries one’s ideal.
Mabel Burke was sweet and good, and
loved him; so one delicious, star-lit
night, after a cosy dinner, he found
himself alone with her in the quiet
little Moorish court of the Burkes’
villa, and as Mabel gave him his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>second cup of coffee he looked at her
approvingly, and on the impulse of the
moment told her he should like to
have her always with him. He meant
it then; and after that it was all easy
sailing, for Boardman Burke was
delighted to give his sister to a man
whom he already loved as a brother.
The gossip of the town had not
reached the visitors in the yacht, and
Miss Schuyler only heard accidentally
that Mr. Travers was engaged to
Miss Burke, for Bob had felt a reluctance
to tell her—had supposed someone
else would—and, finally, seeing
she believed him to be free, he had
<em>dreaded</em> to tell her. And so their
relations progressed undisturbed, and,
like all things under an Oriental sun,
developed rapidly.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had been taking tea at Mr.
Boardman Burkes and looking at his
pictures, when suddenly the artist
said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“I must show you the one I am
doing for Travers’ wedding present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And when someone remarked that
he could take his time to finish the
painting, Boardman Burke had said
very distinctly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no! I expect to have to
give my sister, as well as that best
picture of mine, to Travers before the
year is out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is just possible that Mr. Burke
thought it wise to make this statement,
for occupied though he was in his
work, he had observed that his sister
looked troubled. Although Travers
dropped in every day, he, too, seemed
pre-occupied, or was in a hurry, and
he was seen constantly riding with
Miss Schuyler. Little Mabel was too
seriously in love with him, and believed
in him too deeply, to admit that
he had been the least remiss in his
attentions to her, but she felt relieved,
all the same, to hear that the <em>Liberty</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>would hoist anchor and go over to
Gibraltar the next morning, and from
there continue her course along the
coast of Spain and the Riviera. Even
when she heard Travers and the
American Consul accept an invitation
to go to Gibraltar with the party,
she felt no uneasiness, for he would
return the following noon by the
regular steamer. So she let her
accepted lover stroll off with Miss
Schuyler, only saying a quiet “good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When she looked out from her window
the next morning the pretty little
yacht had disappeared, and all day
she fancied Bob buying up supplies,
which he said he wanted for an
expedition into the interior.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reality, when Mr. Travers had
glanced at Miss Schuyler, after the
announcement made by Mr. Burke of
his engagement, he thought she looked
a trifle pale, but then there is such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>peculiar light when the African sun
comes down into a Moorish garden
through the waving palms that one
gets strange impressions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Schuyler was very silent on
her way to the beach, and Travers did
not see her again till morning, when
he crossed on the yacht to Gibraltar.
During the night a sense of all he had
lost flashed upon him; he could see
no way out of it. He was a man who
prided himself upon keeping his word;
that word was given to Miss Burke,
whom he liked and respected, but
whom he now knew he did not love.
And he had allowed himself to drift
on through two happy weeks, devoting
himself to this stranger, who in return
must certainly despise him for his
cowardice. Distinctly, it was an
awkward position. He felt confident
that, given his freedom, he might win
the woman of his choice, for she was
the kind of woman to inspire him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>do his best, and Bob Travers’ best
was very good indeed, but his freedom
was just what he could not ask for, so
he finally decided to tell Miss Schuyler
the exact truth, and thus at least feel
he had her respect.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the yacht he told her his story,
and she listened, as a woman listens
who has had many disillusionments,
and accepts them as necessities.</p>

<p class='c007'>He thought her very cold when she
only said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have been very good friends,
Mr. Travers. It will be enough
to tell you first that I should have
preferred to hear of your plans from
your own lips. It all seemed so
natural in Tangier, so far from the
conventional outside world, that I
allowed myself to give way to impulses
which I thought under perfect discipline.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you must know, you <em>shall</em>
know, that my heart is yours, that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>are my <em>ideal</em> woman, the one I should
have married,” Travers earnestly
pleaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that is so, let it encourage you
to be strong. Go back, marry your
little girl, and forget one who has
suffered too much to judge anyone.”
Then Travers went down the side of
the yacht into a small boat, and could
only say “God bless you” over her
extended hand before the steps were
pulled up, and the yacht steamed out
on her way to Malaga.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days after at Marseilles the
papers were brought on board, and an
article in them instantly attracted their
attention. It graphically described
a fatal accident that had befallen
Robert MacNeil Travers, who had
just landed from a yacht at Gibraltar
evidently in perfect health. He had
gone up to the summit of the rock,
and stood at the edge of its dangerous
eastern face. His companion, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>American Consul at Tangier, had
stopped a moment to look out to sea
with his glass, and when he turned
round poor Travers had disappeared,
“probably seized with vertigo,” the
paper said; for Mr. Travers was heir
to a large estate, and about to be
married to the sister of the celebrated
artist, Boardman Burke, so no idea of
suicide was entertained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Who shall say whether Miss Schuyler
believed this newspaper version?
Perhaps she remembered Travers’ last
impassioned word, “You <em>shall</em> know
my heart is yours,” and he had taken
this way, the only possible way, to
show her his devotion without being
dishonourable.</p>

<hr class='c010' />

<p class='c007'>Poor little Mabel Burke wept grievously,
but she is again engaged, this
time to a man who is far more domestic
than poor Travers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>And Miss Schuyler? She continues
to be Miss Schuyler, although she is
as fascinating as ever. A woman who
has tested one man’s affection to the
death and not found it wanting, is not
easily won!</p>
